task = "Think before you write an explanatory paragraph of the activity using <thinking> tags. First, think through what action occured on the endpoint and what system executables, line-of-business applications, internal/organizational tools, or external programs/scripts may be involved. Then, think through the impact of the activity on the system and why it may have been triggered (the root cause), given the context. Finally, write an explanation of the activity using <explanation> tags for a junior sysadmin on your team, using your root cause analysis. Keep your response in third-person paragraph-format, using formal/professional language, and referencing specific data. Write only the bare bones necessary information, do not suggest recommended response actions, and avoid inflammatory security language. Begin your <explanation> with \"Per our investigation, this activity indicates\". Keep your response terse and don't mention trivial/well-known information."
